Ok first consider a composite object like a door.
Detach the door from the frame to have two separate objects.
Convert both to poly to prep for skinning.
For the door, create one bone using Animation>BoneTools (two minimum bones will show even if you want just one).
After placing the bone, create another bone for the frame.
Now go to the door object's modifiers and add Skin modifier.
Within skin, go to Add bone and add the bones that correspond to the door.
Go to the frame object's modifiers and skin that too.
Now that skinning is complete, we can start keyframe animation.
Select the door and make sure var is at frame 0.
Select Auto key and create key at 0. Move to the desired frames (25, 50, 75 etc.). Make sure door is back to initial position.
For the door frame, since it is static, click Set key and create key at 0 and at 100.
That's it! Export to FBX.
